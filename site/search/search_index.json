It will guide you to the process of: Setting up a local documentation project. Hosting your documentation project in a remote repository hosting site. Setting up an automated deploying process to a static web site. Prerequisites There are many different tools available \u2013from static site generators to hosting sites\u2013 but for this tutorial we will use: MkDocs to create the static site. MkDocs requires Python and pip package manager. (If you are using Mac you should have them installed already) . GitHub to host the docs repository. Netlify to automate the deploying and to host the web site. We will go through the process of installing and creating the required accounts throughout this tutorial.
