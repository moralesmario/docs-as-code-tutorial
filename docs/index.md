# Docs-as-code Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to create a static site for documentation using a _docs-like-code_ approach. It will guide you to the process of:

- Setting up a local documentation project.
- Hosting your documentation project in a remote repository hosting site.
- Setting up an automated deploying process to a static web site.

## Prerequisites

There are many different tools available –from static site generators to hosting sites– but for this tutorial we will use:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to create the static site.  
    (ℹ) **MkDocs** requires [Python](https://www.python.org) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager. If you are using Mac you should have them installed already. Verify if you have them by running `python --version` and `pip --version` in a **Terminal** window.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the documentation repository.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to automate the deploying process and host the web site.

> The tutorial guides you through the process of installing the required tools.
