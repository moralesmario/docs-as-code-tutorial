# Docs-as-code Tutorial

## Overview

This is a tutorial to create a static site for documentation –just like this one– using a docs-like-code approach. It will guide you to the process of:

- Setting up a local documentation project.
- Hosting your documentation project in a remote repository hosting site.
- Setting up an automated deploying process to a static web site.

## Prerequisites

There are many different tools available –from static site generators to hosting sites– but for this tutorial we will use:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to create the static site.
    - _**MkDocs** requires [Python](https://www.python.org) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager. (If you are using Mac you should have them installed already)_.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the docs repository.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to automate the deploying and to host the web site.

> We will go through the process of installing and creating the required accounts throughout this tutorial.
