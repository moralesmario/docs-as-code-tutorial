It will guide you to the process of: Setting up a local documentation project. Hosting your documentation project in a remote repository hosting site. Setting up an automated deploying process to a static web site. Prerequisites There are many different tools available \u2013from static site generators to hosting sites\u2013 but for this tutorial we will use: MkDocs to create the static site. (\u2139) MkDocs requires Python and pip package manager. If you are using Mac you should have them installed already. Verify if you have them by running python --version and pip --version in a Terminal window. GitHub to host the documentation repository. Netlify to automate the deploying process and host the web site. The tutorial guides you through the process of installing the required tools.

The index.md file is the main page of your new site. You can add more pages there by creating new Markdown files inside the docs folder. We will get to that later. Navigate to your created project with: cd docs-as-code-tutorial You can preview your static site as you work on it by running the following command: mkdocs serve This command starts a local server with your rendered page so you can see how it will look before you publish it. Open a web browser and go to the local http server listed in the last command response ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) to see your rendered page. Customizing Your Site Now you can start modifying the files in your project with your documentation details. Open the index.md file and change the title and information in the file and save them to see the changes update on your local server. Open the mkdocs.yml file and change the site_name value to your documentation project name: site_name: Docs-as-code Tutorial Creating More Pages You can add more pages to your site by modifying the mkdocs.yml configuration file.
